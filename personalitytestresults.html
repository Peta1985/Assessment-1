<h2>MY PERSONALITY TEST RESULTS</h2>
<h3>Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator </h3>
<p>My Result: A Logistician (ISTJ) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet wilful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose (16Personalities n.d.). </p>
<p>I consider these results to be accurate. I am often considered direct, strong-willed and responsible by my command team and subordinates. I am a hardworking, structure driven employee who is task focussed and results driven.  </p>
<p>When working in a team environment I usually volunteer to complete the undesirable tasks first, as they are often overlooked by other team members. This can be an issue at times as it sets up a precedence for the team. Completing these undesirable tasks can also see me working alone on a project, while other focus their attention on the higher profile jobs. This suits my personality type, though can defeat the purpose of teamwork.  </p>
<p>I am keen to understand the reason behind actions and the and will dutifully follow manuals in a sequential order. While I am excited to learn from other people, I can find it difficult to communicate with those who repeat themselves or verbally wander. In group dynamics my bluntness and inflexibility can be intimidating at times. Owing to my military experience, I am well versed with turning my directness on and off, depending on the requirements and environment. However, I will always need to practice patience, understanding and open mindedness.  </p>
<h3>Education Planner Learning Style</h3>
<p>My Result: I am a tactile learner - someone who learns by touching and doing and understands and remembers things through physical movement (Education Planner n.d.).</p>
<p>I agree with these results as I have always found it easier to learn and remember things when I complete the actions myself. </p>
<p>Being a hands-on learner, I like to know how and why things work the way they do. This is important for me to know when working as a team member. I must be mindful that, when asking for assistance from other members, I remind them that I am a ‘hands-on learning’ and ask them to walk through the task with me. Vice, showing or telling me.</p>
<p>The downfall for being a tactile learner is that knowledge is not easily retained unless there is a corresponding skill. I must remember that when asking why something is done a certain way, I allow myself the opportunity to put it into practice to retain the information.</p>
<h3>DiSC Behavioural Assessment</h3>
<p>My Result: I have a Dominance (D) behavioural style meaning that I thrive on accomplishing results (123 Test n.d.). People who have this behavioural style are confident and often blunt, outspoken, and demanding. This is something that I have been made aware of in my workplace (DiSC Profile n.d.).</p>
<p>As a D style, I often take charge of the situation, speak up about conflict as it arises, and am very competitive. I am self-motivated and independent. I see my team members as one team and will not single out any one member. If the team fails, I often take it personally and feel responsible for the fault of the group.</p>
<p>At times, I often lack patience and sensitivity. It is something that I am keenly aware of and always practice resilience in this field. I do this by asking members to contribute thoughts and opinions and listen carefully without interruption. At times I can appear bossy and overbearing, and I acknowledge that I do need to work on relinquishing leadership at times. </p>
