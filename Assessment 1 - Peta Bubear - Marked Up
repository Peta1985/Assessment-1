<h1>COSC2196 INTRODUCTION TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h1>
<h1>ASSESSMENT 1: MY PROFILE REPORT</h1>
<h2>A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME</h2>
<p>Currently Resides: Canberra, ACT.</p>
<p>Education to date: Certificate IV in Training and Assessing.</p>
<p>Family Make-up: Engaged, two sons to a previous marriage, four step-daughters.</p>
<p>Pets: Two dogs, Jake and Marcy and two rats, Kim and Prue.</p>
<p>Love: Dinosaurs.</p>
<p>After leaving school three days before my Year 12 English exam, I enlisted in the Australian Regular Army as an Avionics Technician. I was a baby-faced 17-year-old with a chip on my shoulder and the world at my feet. Unfortunately, I developed an unknown medical illness and voluntarily discharged shortly after enlistment.</p>
<p>Despite not having any qualifications or formal education, I was quickly offered a position with Telstra as a Corporate Consultant to Centrelink. While it was an eye-opening experience, I longed for the rigidity and mateship that Defence offered. So, I gathered up my pride and requested to enlist into the Royal Australian Air Force. After some toing and froing my application was successful and I joined the service in 2007. Since then, I have had the pleasure of travelling to every state in Australia, meeting some incredible people and being a part of some breathtaking and historic moments.</p>
<p>There is an understanding that Military Members are the community’s exemplar. It is expected that we are physically and emotionally fit, well trained and somewhat hardened, ready to deploy at a moment’s notice. We hold ourselves to a high standard and expect nothing less from our peers. Unfortunately for me, this all changed when my unknown illness resurfaced in 2012, two years after my youngest son was born. After undergoing a series of invasive tests I was diagnosed with an inflammatory bowel disease called Ulcerative Colitis.</p>
<p>Over the next five years I battled the disease while serving and being a mother. I was in-and-out of hospital and took all manner of medications to keep me upright. Despite this, nothing worked. My colon stopped working and my kidneys and liver started to fail. I became so unwell that Specialists advised without removing my colon, I had six weeks to live. One fateful afternoon in 2017, after spending almost six months in hospital hooked to tubes and wires, my colon was removed and I was presented with a permanent ileostomy.</p>
<p>I initially considered surrendering my position in the Air Force. After all, there are not too many Military members who sport a fancy ostomy bag.</p>
<p>It didn’t even match my shoes. However, I proved that I was not the sum of my parts (or lack thereof) and Defence agreed to keep me on as a permanent member.</p>
<p>Four years later I am still serving. My ileostomy has not defined me as an aviator, as a mother or as a person. I am proud of my contributions to Australia, my dedication to my family and of my strength and determination.</p>
<h2>MY RELATIONSHIP WITH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p>I have always felt overwhelmed by IT. Growing up in rural Australia armed with only with a typewriter did nothing for my development of fundamental knowledge, skills or appreciation. This didn’t happen until well after I left home. My classroom consisted of three outdated IBM computers with only Word, Excel, Solitaire and Minesweeper loaded. Regardless, my parents’ opinion was that I should not be completing assignments on the computer until I mastered them on paper first.</p>
<p>As I never got that computer from my parents, I will assume that I never mastered the paper version.</p>
<p>As ridiculous as that may sound, there are still pockets of our community where people have never experienced IT in a broad sense, nor have the funds available to stay connected on modern devices.</p>
<p>As an adult my experience with IT has been somewhat limited. Outside of working in an office-based setting and having a partner who was a gamer, I found the whole thing overwhelming.  At work I knew what I had to do on my computer, so I did it. At home I had no idea what my partner was doing, so I avoided it. It was the vicious cycle of blocking and avoiding technology that has gotten me to where I am – a person who is quite the novice despite my relatively young age and professional status.</p>
<p>Over the last few years Defence has invested a large amount of time and resources to creating a proper data strategy. Department of Defence (2021) has identified that as the world is experiencing exponential growth in data creation and digitisation, they have begun to realise the potential exposures and conflicts that could come of it. With all the changes and improvements being made, I have come to realise that if I am to continue succeeding in this industry, I need to learn more about IT and data.</p>
<p>I researched opportunities for learning but many courses focused solely on programming and back-end development. I attended a few workshops run by She Codes and while informative, were not what I was looking for. My local TAFE ran several basic courses but I needed something that was going to be flexible and work around my business hours and parenting obligations.</p>
<p>I contacted Open Universities Australia and discussed my issues with the representative. We agreed that a Bachelor of IT through RMIT would be best suited to my requirements. These initial fundamental courses will give me a wonderful foundation on which to build, and as the course continues, so will my knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>By the time I have successfully completed the Bachelor of IT I hope to have the essential skills, knowledge and attitude required to be an effective contributor to Defence data discussions.</p>
<h2>MY IDEAL IT JOB</h2>
<p>Department of Defence (2021) suggested that Defence will consider raising a data specialist career stream specifically for the Australian Defence Force. I am very interested in being part of this new venture. Unfortunately, Defence has not released any further information on the topic and I am left wondering what these positions might look like. As the ADF already employs uniformed Data Analysts, it stands to reason that a Data Scientist stream will be created to support.</p>
<p>This line or work interests me as I enjoy bringing order to chaos. I possess high attention to detail attributes and am used to trawling through large amounts of information to identify trends or discrepancies.</p>
<p>Data scientists manage, gather and analyse large amounts of data. This data is typically in a raw or unstructured state and is pulled from sources such as social media, smart devices or though Artificial Intelligence and/or Machine Learning. Maths, statistics and computer science are employed to achieve this. They analyse, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organisations. Data Scientists require ‘Programming skills (SAS, R, Python), statistical and mathematical skills, storytelling and data visualization, Hadoop, SQL, machine learning’ (Berkeley School of Information 2021, para. 13). Once qualified, I believe this is something I will be well suited to.</p>
<p>After researching many different jobs I happened upon a job advertisement for a Data Scientist with Seek (2021). If Defence goes down a similar route to the advertisement, I anticipate that I will need to achieve suitable education and work experience to be competitive.</p>
<p>The advertised skills, qualifications and experience required for this position include:</p>
<p>•	Post graduate qualification in a quantitative discipline such as Physics, Math, Computer Science</p>
<p>•	Three years work experience with data assets to produce a data strategy</p>
<p>•	Experience working with complex data </p>
<p>•	Experience in *nix environment </p>
<p>•	Experience in machine learning algorithms, stats, and model performance </p>
<p>•	Experience with writing useable code (Python, R, Spark) </p>
<p>•	Experience with SQL data extraction and processing </p>
<p>•	Experience in cloud computing </p>
<p>•	Experience in continuous integration continuous delivery is preferred </p>
<p>•	Comfortable and confident to work with and around a professional software development team </p>
<p>•	Possess good communication skills and ability to collaborate as part of a team</p>
<p>•	Ability to work in a dynamic work environment. </p>
<p>Currently I have very little practical or tangible skills, experience or knowledge required for this position. Despite my communication skills and ability to work in complex, high-pressure and dynamic work environments, I am certainly underqualified for this position. To consider myself an appropriate candidate for this position, I will need to:</p>
<p>•	Receive a post graduate qualification in a Quantitative discipline, ideally a Master of Data Science through RMIT. To achieve this, I need to:</p>
<p>o	Complete my Bachelor of Information Technology. (While not a prerequisite for Master of Data Science, it will provide an excellent steppingstone to start, given my limited IT knowledge and experience)</p>
<p>o	Dedicate an additional four years part-time study to complete.</p>
<p>•	Once graduated, seek position/s in which to complete at least three years’ work experience with a focus on gaining the required experience:</p>
<p>o	experience working with data </p>
<p>o	Experience with producing data strategies</p>
<p>o	Experience with *nix environment </p>
<p>o	Experience with machine learning algorithms, stats, and model performance </p>
<p>o	Experience with writing code and programming</p>
<p>o	Experience with SQL data extraction and processing </p>
<p>o	Experience with cloud computing </p>
<p>o	Experience with continuous integration continuous delivery is preferred. </p>
<h2>MY PERSONALITY</h2>
<h3>Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator </h3>
<p>My Result: A Logistician (ISTJ) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet wilful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose (16Personalities n.d.). </p>
<p>I consider these results to be accurate. I am often considered direct, strong-willed and responsible by my command team and subordinates. I am a hardworking, structure driven employee who is task focussed and results driven.  </p>
<p>When working in a team environment I usually volunteer to complete the undesirable tasks first, as they are often overlooked by other team members. This can be an issue at times as it sets up a precedence for the team. Completing these undesirable tasks can also see me working alone on a project, while other focus their attention on the higher profile jobs. This suits my personality type, though can defeat the purpose of teamwork.  </p>
<p>I am keen to understand the reason behind actions and the and will dutifully follow manuals in a sequential order. While I am excited to learn from other people, I can find it difficult to communicate with those who repeat themselves or verbally wander. In group dynamics my bluntness and inflexibility can be intimidating at times. Owing to my military experience, I am well versed with turning my directness on and off, depending on the requirements and environment. However, I will always need to practice patience, understanding and open mindedness.  </p>
<h3>Education Planner Learning Style</h3>
<p>My Result: I am a tactile learner - someone who learns by touching and doing and understands and remembers things through physical movement (Education Planner n.d.).</p>
<p>I agree with these results as I have always found it easier to learn and remember things when I complete the actions myself. </p>
<p>Being a hands-on learner, I like to know how and why things work the way they do. This is important for me to know when working as a team member. I must be mindful that, when asking for assistance from other members, I remind them that I am a ‘hands-on learning’ and ask them to walk through the task with me. Vice, showing or telling me.</p>
<p>The downfall for being a tactile learner is that knowledge is not easily retained unless there is a corresponding skill. I must remember that when asking why something is done a certain way, I allow myself the opportunity to put it into practice to retain the information.</p>
<h3>DiSC Behavioural Assessment</h3>
<p>My Result: I have a Dominance (D) behavioural style meaning that I thrive on accomplishing results (123 Test n.d.). People who have this behavioural style are confident and often blunt, outspoken, and demanding. This is something that I have been made aware of in my workplace (DiSC Profile n.d.).</p>
<p>As a D style, I often take charge of the situation, speak up about conflict as it arises, and am very competitive. I am self-motivated and independent. I see my team members as one team and will not single out any one member. If the team fails, I often take it personally and feel responsible for the fault of the group.</p>
<p>At times, I often lack patience and sensitivity. It is something that I am keenly aware of and always practice resilience in this field. I do this by asking members to contribute thoughts and opinions and listen carefully without interruption. At times I can appear bossy and overbearing, and I acknowledge that I do need to work on relinquishing leadership at times. </p>
<h2>PROJECT IDEA: SMARTER GIFTER </h2>
<p>As the year draws to a close, I am hearing the usual Christmas script being successfully completed by everyone I meet. It is like a chorus the echoed in every house, shop and workplace across the country:</p>
<p>“What do you hope Santa will bring you for Christmas?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure”, “I haven’t thought about it” and “I don’t need anything” are all socially acceptable answer. </p>
<p>This patter is as old as Santa Clause himself. </p>
<p>‘38% of US consumers say that guessing what people want is their greatest annoyance when shopping for presents’ (Emarsys 2021, para. 1). This is only surprising as I would have guessed the figure to be more. Such is the issue with the gift giving roulette, that Australian retailer Myer created an entire 2021 advertisement campaign surrounding it. Titled Unriddle Christmas, Myer (2021) explores the dreaded anxiety around ensuring you give the perfect gift to the ones you love.</p>
<p>But what if I told you that these complexities could be solved through the automation of inspiration?</p>
<p>I would like to present my project idea. The Smarter Gifter mobile app will revolutionise the gift buying process and ensure that your affections are always on-point. In essence, the Smarter Gifter app will remind you, the user, of any programmed upcoming special occasions such as a birthdays or anniversaries. The application is inbuild with a profile of each of your loved ones and will make recommendations and suggestions based on their interests, age, hobbies and location. </p>
<p>Using the application will be user friendly and intuitive. Once you have downloaded the app to your preferred smart device, you can easily create a profile for all of your nearest and dearest. The creation of a profile is easy, and once created, will only require minimal maintenance. The profile will be created using information such as:</p>
<p>•	Name</p>
<p>•	Photo</p>
<p>•	Date of Birth</p>
<p>•	Town/Suburb</p>
<p>•	Interests</p>
<p>•	Turn Notifications on/off for special days (select from a pre-determined list of special occasions, or create your own!). Preloaded days include:</p>
<p>o	Birthday Day</p>
<p>o	Father’s Day</p>
<p>o	Mother’s Day</p>
<p>o	Variety of culturally appropriate days</p>
<p>o	Variety of religious days </p>
<p>o	Anniversary</p>
<p>The easy-to-use set-up will make creating profiles a breeze! </p>
<p>As you see products or think of gift ideas that would be suitable for the receiver, you simply update their profile. The application can save links to the items that you know they will love directly to their profile. </p>
<p>Still unsure what to get them? No worries! The application will consider their interests, age and location and make recommendations and suggestions for you. This will either give the opportunity to shop online or provide you with the inspiration and get those creative juices flowing. </p>
<p>As a programmed date draws near, a birthday for example, you will receive an automated notification sent directly to your email or mobile, reminding you of the approaching celebration. </p>
<p>As this will be a Smartphone Application, the user will not require any new or specialised hardware. They will simply be able to download the app from their chosen app store and start creating profiles for their friends and family immediately!</p>
<p>I am quite the novice at information technology, and this project will be a welcomed place to start learning how to create an app from the concept phase. </p>
<p>After some research and consideration, I consider that C++ would be the best programming language as it is the primary language used within the mobile industry (EDUCBA 2020). This language, best suited to Android OS, iOS, and Windows, has a high-performance server and is supported by Windows and Mac OS. Many programmers seem well versed in C++, and with some instruction and practice, I anticipate it would be easy to navigate. </p>
<p>Once I have received relevant instruction and experience in learning C++, I would be looking at a relevant Integrated Development Environment (IDE)in which to write the code. I would consider Xamarin as it is appears to be the most popular integrated environment developed for iOS, Android, and Windows.</p>
<p>As the app gains traction with users, I could look to purchase personal data through Google. Smarter Gifter could link with members Google accounts and refine gift suggestions based on their algorithms and personalised Google advertisements.</p>
<p>The project will be successful when people start receiving solicited reminders filled with associated gift ideas and inspirations for their loved ones. This will result in a more excited and highly anticipated Christmas season, and the assurance that the giver is going to provide something meaningful and considerate.
<p>Moving on from gift giving, the app will have the ability to evolve to suit other applications. Its design is simple enough:</p>
<p>Trigger Event + Online Resources = Outcome</p>
<p>The Smarter Gifter concept could be applied to events such as large corporate meetings or for research purposes. As a date or event is achieved, and the app could automatically send through relevant links and information from current newsworthy articles. </p>
